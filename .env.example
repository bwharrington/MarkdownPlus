# MarkdownPlus - Development Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your API keys for development

# xAI API Key (for Grok models)
# Get your key from: https://console.x.ai/
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here

# Anthropic API Key (for Claude models)
# Get your key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# OpenAI API Key (for GPT models)

# Note: .env file is for DEVELOPMENT ONLY
# In production builds, API keys are stored securely using:
# - Windows: DPAPI (Data Protection API)
# - macOS: Keychain
# - Linux: libsecret
#
# The .env file takes precedence over secure storage when present,
# allowing developers to quickly test without configuring keys in the UI.
