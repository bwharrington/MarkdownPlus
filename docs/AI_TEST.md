## What is a reStructuredText (RST) Document?

reStructuredText (RST) is a plaintext markup language commonly used for technical documentation, particularly in the Python community. It was designed for writing technical documentation and is the default format for Python's documentation system, Sphinx.

Key features of RST documents:

- **Extensible** - Supports custom directives and roles for advanced formatting
- **Rich syntax** - More powerful than Markdown with features like tables, footnotes, and citations
- **Documentation-focused** - Built specifically for creating technical documentation
- **Sphinx integration** - Seamlessly works with Sphinx to generate beautiful documentation websites
- **Cross-referencing** - Advanced linking capabilities between documents and sections
- **Standardized** - Part of the Python Docutils project with formal specifications

RST files typically use the `.rst` or `.rest` file extension.

Common RST syntax examples:
- Headings use underlines: `====` for titles, `----` for sections
- Emphasis uses `*italic*` and `**bold**`
- Code blocks use `::` followed by indented text
- Directives like `.. note::` or `.. code-block::` add special functionality
