## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Configure AI API keys for development
# Copy .env.example to .env and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys

# Start in development mode
npm run dev

# Or build and run
npm start
```

### Development API Keys

For development, you can use a `.env` file to configure AI API keys:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your API keys:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Restart the application

**Note**: In production builds, API keys are stored securely using the system's credential storage (DPAPI/Keychain/libsecret) via the Settings dialog. The `.env` file is only for development convenience.

## Building

```bash
# Windows
npm run package

# macOS
npm run package-mac

# Linux
